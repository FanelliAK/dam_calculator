damage_calculator for a roguelite

this damage calculator sometimes get's stuck on the dice roll miss, it's very random and 99% of the time works just fine.  if you get this buggy loops just stop run.  I use this program with Thonny so I'm able to edit and then run to get output.

it has 3 variables, hp, player attack, monster defense
locations for damage calulator and critical
d_20 dice roll for hit chance and critical/miss
if damage is less than block with the calculator a block happens.
